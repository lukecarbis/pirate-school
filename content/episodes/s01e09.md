In this episode, we dive into the complex and ever-changing role of technology in homeschooling life. From screen time rules and voice assistants to routers and handwriting books, we unpack how our family navigates the push and pull of iPads, Minecraft, and message dictation. Plus: a music tangent, a fantasy sidebar, and practical advice for staying flexible while raising digital natives.
